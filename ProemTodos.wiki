This simple todo within my vimwiki needs to be moved to the github proem wiki.
I'll do this tonight. I would love a place to work on this documentation
on/offline. Stop documenting within code.

**The Url object needs to be refined.**

    * The ability to inject parts (params) into any position within the url would be of awesome benifit and would help move this functionality out of the _Dispatch_ component.
    
The dispatch process still needs cleaning. I need to find a flexible method of
recursively iterating through various 'inject' staratigies.

Getting very close to time to start working on implementing an
AbstractController, very exciting.

The Url object could still use with some validation.

Create a script to bump the version number.

**Im not merging naything into master until the controllers are in place.**

It's still only a tiny framework we are working on here, this, including all comments:
