UnrealIRCd Commands
v2.0

Many times I have had users asking me how some command works & what are all the different
options they can use with it. So I thought it would be a good idea & helpful for both chatters & IRC
Operators , If they had a centralised command reference , rather than having to look all over for
the syntax of new or old commands. In this list , I have tried to incorporate all the commands which
time , this manual will be ever changing :-)

Here is the command list :  

      IRC Users Commands

      message at regular intervals if no other activity detected coming
      from a connection.  If a connection fails to respond to a PING
      message within a set amount of time, that connection is closed.  A
      PING message MAY be sent even if the connection is active.
      Note that this is different from a CTCP PING command..

      in your watch list logs on or off.
      The watch list DOES NOT REMAIN BETWEEN SESSIONS - you (or your
      script or client) must add the nicknames to your watch list every

      The "?" in /HELPOP means query the help system and if you get no
      response you can choose '!' to send it to the Help Operators online
      Using neither ? nor ! will mean the command will be first queried
      within the help system and if no match if found , it will be 
      forwarded to the help operators.
      

      Example: HELPOP ?CHMODES  (Channel Modes Help)
               HELPOP ?UMODES   (User Mode Help)

      *** LIST Command ***

      Provides a complete listing of all channels on the network. If a search string is

      Syntax:  LIST <search string>
      Example: LIST
               LIST *ircd*

      New extended /LIST command options are supported.  To use these
      features, you will likely need to prefix the LIST command with
      /QUOTE to avoid your client interpreting the command.

      Usage: /QUOTE LIST options
    

      If you don't include any options, the default is to send you the
      entire unfiltered list of channels. Below are the options you can
      use, and what channels LIST will return when you use them.
      >number  List channels with more than <number> people.
      <number  List channels with less than <number> people.
      C>number List channels created between now and <number> minutes ago.
      C<number List channels created earlier than <number> minutes ago.
      T>number List channels whose topics are older than <number> minutes
               (Ie., they have not changed in the last <number> minutes.
      T<number List channels whose topics are newer than <number> minutes.
      *mask*   List channels that match *mask*
      !*mask*  List channels that do not match *mask*

      NOTE : C & T parameters do not exist in Unreal 3.1.1-Darkshades.
      LIST defaults to sending a list of channels with 2 or more members,
      so use the >0 option to get the full channel listing.  

*** PRIVMSG/NOTICE Command ***

      PRIVMSG and NOTICE, which are used internally by the client for
      /msg and /notice, in UnrealIRCd support two additional formats:
      /msg @#channel <text> will send the text to channel-ops on the
      given channel only. /msg @+#channel <text> will send the text
      to both ops and voiced users on the channel. While some clients
      may support these as-is, on others (such as ircII), it's necessary
      to use /quote privmsg @#channel <text> instead. You can also use
      % to signify HalfOps on the channel.

      Syntax:  MSG <nick>,<nick2>,<nick3>,<nick4> :<text>
      Example: PRIVMSG hAtbLaDe :Hello. 
               PRIVMSG hAtbLaDe,Hatter,GoodBot :Hello everyone!

      The format for the NOTICE command is the same as above.

**** KNOCK Command ****

      For channels which are invite only, you can "Knock" on the channel to request an invite.
  

      The following criteria must be met : 
          - Channel is not +K (No knocks)
          - Channel is not +I (No invites!)
         You're not banned!
