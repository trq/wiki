My new workflow is now as follows:

I have a "master" branch that is the only branch that I dcommit from and that
clone the SVN repository (-s assume you have a standard SVN layout in the
repository trunk/, branches/, and tags/):

__git svn clone [-s] <svn-url>__

I work on a local branch "work" (-b creates the branch "work")

__git checkout -b work__

commit locally into the "work" branch (-s to sign-off your commit message). In
the sequel, I assume you made 3 local commits

...
__(work)$> git commit -s -m "msg 1"__
...
__(work)$> git commit -s -m "msg 2"__
...
__(work)$> git commit -s -m "msg 3"__

Now you want to commit onto the SVN server

[Eventually] stash the modifications you don't want to see committed on the SVN
server (often you commented some code in the main file just because you want to
accelerate the compilation and focus on a given feature)

__(work)$> git stash__

rebase the master branch with the SVN repository (to update from the SVN server)

__(work)$> git checkout master__
__(master)$> git svn rebase__

go back to the work branch and rebase with master

__(master)$> git checkout work__
__(work)$> git rebase master__

Ensure everything is fine using, for instance:

__(work)$> git log --graph --oneline --decorate__

Now it's time to merge all three commits from the "work" branch into "master"
using this wonderful --no-ff option

__(work)$> git checkout master__
__(master)$> git merge --no-ff work__

You can notice the status of the logs:

__(master)$> git log --graph --oneline --decorate__

* 56a779b (work, master) Merge branch 'work'
|\  
| * af6f7ae msg 3
| * 8750643 msg 2
| * 08464ae msg 1
|/  
* 21e20fa (git-svn) last svn commit

Now you probably want to edit (amend) the last commit for your SVN dudes
(otherwise they will only see a single commit with the message "Merge branch
'work'"

__(master)$> git commit --amend__

Finally commit on the SVN server

__(master)$> git svn dcommit__

Go back to work and eventually recover your stashed files:

__(master)$> git checkout work__
__(work)$> git stash pop__
