This is my personal wiki used for storing different tips and notes. Ive put it on github so I can easily sync it between various different machines I use at home & work. I guess others might find it usefull too.

It is a vimwiki http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki wiki which means it's easily maintainable and available easily while I'm working.
